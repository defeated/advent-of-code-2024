## Background

Given a list of location IDs, solve the following scenarios:

### Part 1

> To find the total distance between the left list and the right list, add up
> the distances between all of the pairs you found. In the example above, this
> is 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5, a total distance of 11!
>
> Your actual left and right lists contain many location IDs. What is the total
> distance between your lists?

### Part 2

> This time, you'll need to figure out exactly how often each number from the
> left list appears in the right list. Calculate a total similarity score by
> adding up each number in the left list after multiplying it by the number of
> times that number appears in the right list.
>
> Once again consider your left and right lists. What is their similarity
> score?
